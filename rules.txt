Hundreds of years ago, your ancestor stole a magical tarot deck from Fate herself— and it came with a terrible cost. Once every 23 years, one member of your family must face Fate in a duel with rules only known to your opponent. And every time, generation after generation, the outcome is the same: Fate claims their soul. Today, it’s your turn. Can you defeat Fate?

Rules :

1. When you take a number, Fate takes every factor of that number still on the table.

2. You can only take numbers that have at least one factor on the table.

3. When you run out of moves, Fate takes all the remaining cards.

4. You play with cards numbered 1 through 23.

5. To win, the sum of your  cards must be greater than the sum of Fate's cards at the end of the game. Fate wins on a tie.

6. Certain cards grant special rewards if you take them AND win the duel:
    - (2) The High Priestess : The curse will be broken
    - (6) The Lovers : You'll soon meet your True Love
    - (10) Wheel of Fortune : You'll receive unimaginable riches
